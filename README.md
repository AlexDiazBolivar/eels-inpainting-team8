# EELS Image Inpainting

This is the repository for team 8 of the ISAE-Supaero Hackathon (March 2020), subject 4: Unsupervised Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) images inpainting be Deep Neural Network.

This subject is motivated by the high noise and sample damaging inherent to EELS method. 
The objective is to obtained the result of an EELS from a partially sampled version, incomplete and possbly noisy.

Some methods have already been proposed in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01225).
This project aims at transfering [deep image prior method](https://dmitryulyanov.github.io/deep_image_prior) method for RGB images inpainting to EELS images.
